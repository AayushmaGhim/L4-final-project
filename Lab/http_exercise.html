    <h1><center>HTTP and Security Lab Exercise</center></h1><br><hr>

    <h2>Q.1.  What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)? </h2>
    <h3>Ans:  Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes.</h3><br><hr>

    <h2>Q.2  Why is HTTP called a stateless protocol? </h2>
    <h3>Ans:  HTTP is a stateless protocol because the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests. </h3><br><hr>

    <h2>Q.3.  Describe the three phases of establishing a session using client-server protocols such as HTTP. </h2>
    <h3>Ans:  In client-server protocols, like HTTP, sessions consist of three phases:<ol>

        <li>The client establishes a TCP connection (or the appropriate connection if the transport layer is not TCP).</li>
        <li>The client sends its request, and waits for the answer.</li>
        <li>The server processes the request, sending back its answer, providing a status code and appropriate data.</li></ol>
    </h3><br><hr>

    <h2>Q.4.  Describe the parameters on a get and post request. </h2>
    <h3>Ans:  GET parameters (also called URL parameters or query strings) are used when a client, such as a browser, requests a particular resource from a web server using the HTTP protocol. These parameters are usually name-value pairs, separated by an equals sign =. An example URL could look like: https://www.example.com/index.html?name1=value1&name2=value2 . GET parameters always start with a question mark ?. This is followed by the name of the variable and the corresponding value, separated by an =. If an URL contains more than one parameter, they are separated by an Ampersand &. <br>
    POST is a request method supported by HTTP used by the World Wide Web. By design, the POST request method requests that a web server accepts the data enclosed in the body of the request message, most likely for storing it. It is often used when uploading a file or when submitting a completed web form. Each key-value pair is separated by an '&' character, and each key is separated from its value by an '=' character. Keys and values are both escaped by replacing spaces with the '+' character and then using percent-encoding on all other non-alphanumeric characters. For example, the key-value pairs
    Name: Gareth Wylie
    Age: 24
    Formula: a+b == 21
    
    are encoded as:
    
    Name=Gareth+Wylie&Age=24&Formula=a%2Bb+%3D%3D+21
    </h3><br><hr>

    <h2>Q.5.  What are the HTTP response status code and What do the HTTP status codes, 200, and 404 indicate? </h2>
    <h3>Ans:  HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes:<br><ul>
        <li>Informational responses (100–199)</li>
        <li>Successful responses (200–299)</li>
        <li>Redirects (300–399)</li>
        <li>Client errors (400–499)</li>
        <li>Server errors (500–599)</li></ul>
        The HTTP status code 200 indicates that the request has succeeded whereas the HTTP status code 404 indicates that the the server can not find the requested resource.
    </h3><br><hr>

    <h2>Q.6.  What are HTTP cookies? Give an example. </h2>
    <h3>Ans:  An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser. The browser may store it and send it back with later requests to the same server. Typically, it's used to tell if two requests came from the same browser — keeping a user logged-in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol. Cookies are mainly used for three purposes:<ul>        
        <li>Session management:<br>
            Logins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember</li>
        <li>Personalization:<br>
            User preferences, themes, and other settings</li>
        <li>Tracking:<br>
        Recording and analyzing user behavior</li></ul> 
        Each cookie is effectively a small lookup table containing pairs of (key, data) values - for example (firstname, John) (lastname, Smith). Once the cookie has been read by the code on the server or client computer, the data can be retrieved and used to customise the web page appropriately.</h3><br><hr>

    <h2>Q.7  Why are cookies a security issue? </h2>
    <h3>Ans:  Cookies sent over HTTP (port 80) are not secure as the HTTP protocol is not encrypted. hey can't infect computers with viruses or other malware. However, some cyberattacks can hijack cookies and enable access to your browsing sessions. The danger lies in their ability to track individuals' browsing histories.</h3><br><hr>

    <h2>Q.8  Describe session hijacking and XSS. </h2>
    <h3>Ans:  Session hijacking is an attack where a user session is taken over by an attacker. A session starts when you log into a service, for example your banking application, and ends when you log out. The attack relies on the attacker’s knowledge of your session cookie, so it is also called cookie hijacking or cookie side-jacking. Although any computer session could be hijacked, session hijacking most commonly applies to browser sessions and web applications.<br>Cross-site scripting(XSS) is probably the most dangerous and widespread method of web session hijacking. By exploiting server or application vulnerabilities, attackers can inject client-side scripts (typically JavaScript) into web pages, causing your browser to execute arbitrary code when it loads a compromised page. If the server doesn’t set the HttpOnly attribute in session cookies, injected scripts can gain access to your session key, providing attackers with the necessary information for session hijacking.</h3><br><hr>

    <h2>Q.9  Describe Cross-site request forgery(CSRF). </h2>
    <h3>Ans:  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated. With a little help of social engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker’s choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.</h3><br><hr>

    <h2>Q.10  What are Cross-site HTTP requests (CORS) and what requests use CORS? </h2>
    <h3>Ans:  Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any other origins (domain, scheme, or port) than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a “preflight” request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request. An example of a cross-origin request: the front-end JavaScript code served from https://domain-a.com uses XMLHttpRequest to make a request for https://domain-b.com/data.json.<br>
    This cross-origin sharing standard can enable cross-site HTTP requests for:<ul>
        <li>Invocations of the XMLHttpRequest or Fetch APIs, as discussed above.</li>
        <li>Web Fonts (for cross-domain font usage in @font-face within CSS), so that servers can deploy TrueType fonts that can only be cross-site loaded and used by web sites that are permitted to do so.</li>
        <li>WebGL textures.</li>
        <li>Images/video frames drawn to a canvas using drawImage().</li>
        <li>SS Shapes from images</li></ul>
